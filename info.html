    Hi, my name is Patrick Kontschak, I'm 23 years old and I'm a developer.

    I was born in Germany and currently live in Pforzheim, Germany, but spent the last 3 years, from 2009-2012, in Canada, among others Toronto, and gained work-related experience as a Web Developer. This experience has also made me fluent in the English language.

    I'm a Mac and Linux user, a headbanger and beard-crawler (my own beard, of course).
